**What is Docker**

    Docker is a container platform that allows you to separate your application from the underlying infrastructure 
    by bundling up your code and all of its dependencies into a self-contained entity that will run the same on any 
    supported system.
    
    Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.
    
    The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called containerization.
