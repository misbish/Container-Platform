**Kubernetes Basics**

    Kubernetes is a production-grade, open-source platform that orchestrates the placement (scheduling) 
    and execution of application containers within and across computer clusters.
    
    Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014.
    
    K8s is an abbreviation derived by replacing the 8 letters “ubernete” with “8”.
